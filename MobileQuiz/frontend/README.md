# MobileQuiz FrontEnd

This folder is only about the frontend, which renderes the smartphone views of the quiz. It does not use the ILIAS Framework and therefore could be moved somewhere else.
But as it needs access to the ILIAS database, the configuration has to be changed, if the frontend is moved. 

For licenses please refer to top level location of this software and its documentation.
